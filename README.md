# ballAR

### Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive AR experience for shooting hoops in basketball for players on the go. Players interact with a simple menu to choose their level and start a game. Possible levels include still hoop, moving hoop (lateral), and moving hoop (rotating). When the game begins, players will be able to flick a ball towards the hoop, and the game will keep track of their shooting accuracy. The purpose of this application will be its ease of use. Users will just need to find a flat wall and the game can begin!

For the Milestone, I plan to have a working implementation of the basketball and hoop finished. 

### Methods
This project will be developed and tested for Android via Unity and Vuforia. I will probably be using assets from the Unity asset store. I may use additional APIs/algorithms for the movement of the ball but that is TBD.
